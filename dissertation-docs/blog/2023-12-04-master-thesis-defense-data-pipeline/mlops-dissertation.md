On 4th of December, I attended to the MSc Thesis Defence about Data Pipelines for and MLOps system. The work developed was more focus on data pipelines and in ingestion problems, since it uses kafka and cassandra to deal with concurrency.

The experience of seeing a MSc Thesis Defence was very interesting. I could see how the process works and how the jury evaluates the work. I also could see the work of other students and how they developed their work, and I think that is very valuable, so when I have to do my MSc Thesis Defence I will be more prepared.
