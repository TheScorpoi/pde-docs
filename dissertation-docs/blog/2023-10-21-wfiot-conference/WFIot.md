The IEEE WFIoT Conference took place in Aveiro in October 2023. I was a volunteer in the conference and I had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world and to learn about the latest technologies in the IoT area. Besides IoT is not the main area of my research, there was a lot of sessions where Machine Learning came up as a solution to solve some problems in IoT, so I found it very interesting to attend those sessions, and to learn more about the application of Machine Learning in the IoT field.

The conference took place in Centro de Congressos de Aveiro between 16 to 20 of October. I really liked to participate as a volunteer because it was my first time in a conference, and then in this dimension, it was a really pleasure to be part of the organization team. 

As a volunteer, I had to be aware of the setup for the session, like calibrating the camera, managing the zoom session for those who are assisting virtually, and helping the speakers with any doubts. 

With this, I had the opportunity to assist to a lot of sessions and know a bit more about the world of IoT. I have attended sessions about cybersecurity in IoT, How IoT is using Machine Learning techniques to extract intelligence from all the data that is collected in devices, the relationship between IoT and Digital Twins, and the IoT for road safety. It was a really good experience because it was my first time at a world conference. I learned more about IoT, and last but not least, I met new people in the session that made the experience even greater. I made contacts with people from all parts of the world, and it was very pleasant.

The conference was not about my main research area, but as I said before, there were topics like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence that were addressed in the context of IoT, so I learned more about it. I will highlight, for example, a research where the objective was to optimize the energy consumption of houses. The houses were monitored by IoT devices, and the data was collected to make predictions using Machine Learning models to optimize energy consumption, mainly in house heating.

Another example that caught my attention was a research work where the researchers integrated Machine Learning techniques and Virtual Reality in wind farms. They could extract data from the IoT devices and make predictions and navigate through the wind farm using virtual reality glasses to check the turbines and see metrics about it.
