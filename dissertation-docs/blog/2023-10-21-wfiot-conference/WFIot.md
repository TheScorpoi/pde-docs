The IEEE WFIot Conference took place in Aveiro in October 2023. I was a volunteer in the conference and I had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world and to learn about the latest technologies in the IoT area. Besides IoT is not the main area of my research, there was a lot of sessions where Machine Learning came up as a solution to solve some problems in IoT, so I found it very interesting to attend to those sessions, and to learn more about the applition of Machine Learning in IoT field.

The conference take place in Centro de Congressos de Aveiro between 16 to 20 of October. I reaaly like to participated as volunteer because it was my first time in a conference and then in this dimension, it was a reaaly pleasure to be part of the organization team.
