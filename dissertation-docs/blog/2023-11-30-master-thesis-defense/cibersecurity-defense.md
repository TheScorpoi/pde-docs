On 30th of November, I attended to the MSc Thesis Defence about Cibersecurity. The work developed was an mobile application that scans the users application and make a "report" about each app based on the permissions that the app has.

The experience of seeing a MSc Thesis Defence was very interesting. I could see how the process works and how the jury evaluates the work. I also could see the work of other students and how they developed their work, and I think that is very valuable, so when I have to do my MSc Thesis Defence I will be more prepared.
